
Changes for version 1.23:

	Big changes include addition of atom parsing for the 
	remainder of the periodic table. Much of this data was
	provided by Julian Keates <julian@nmr400a.mols.susx.ac.uk>.
	Thanks Julian!

	Combined atoms2.inc and atoms_glass2.inc.  atoms_glass2.inc
	is no longer needed.

	Removed the "CPK" rendering option since it was the default
	anyway


Installation (DOS, UNIX)

	This is a command-line app, so copy the program into some directory on your
	path, and copy the *.inc files into your normal POV-RAY include library
	path.
