Babel
=====

    Many people have requested the capability of reading and converting
more than just `PDB' files from `pdb2pov'.  However, adding a good
assortment of molecular file filters is not trivial. I am now including
the program `Babel' with this distribution.  `Babel' was written by Pat
Walters and Matt Stahl; the program can read and write a wide variety
of atomic structure file formats. For more information on `Babel' see
the file `Babel.doc'.
